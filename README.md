# My Ruby on Rails Project

This project was created by following the official [Ruby on Rails Documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/). The purpose of this project is to apply and deepen my understanding of Rails concepts while building a functional web application.

## Features

- Built with the Ruby on Rails framework
- Implements MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture
- RESTful routes and CRUD operations
- Database integration using Active Record
- Front-end styled with CSS and optional frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap or TailwindCSS)
